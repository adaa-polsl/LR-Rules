# LR-Rules
An algorithm for learning rule sets from survival data

## Installation and usage

UPDATE: LR-rules is now the part of [RuleKit](https://github.com/adaa-polsl/RuleKit) - our comprehensive suite for rule-based learning. We suggest using RuleKit for analyses as we constatly improve its functionality and keep it up to date.
